# EA Tracking

A program for Environmental Alliance (EA), an extracurricular I was leading throughout high school. 

The EA had a job, every week, to track the environmental efforts of teachers (i.e.: turning off lights, etc). This app allows the members of the EA to keep the data locally, and be able to view it in spreadsheet. 

I wrote the app with my parnter, Vivian Luu. I did most of the backend, while Vivian did the graphics.
